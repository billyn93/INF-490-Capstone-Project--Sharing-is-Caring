# INF-490-Capstone-Project--Sharing-is-Caring
Final Project for my INF 490 Capstone Seminar in Informatics Class
The idea of this project was to provide a platform for university students to help each other out- via sharing textbooks, classroom tips, and providing tutoring services. This project was created through the adaptation of Reece Kinney's project from his "Build a Social Network from Scratch: JavaScript PHP + MySQL" udemy class and also from Inki's PHP and MySQL Tutorial
