# INF-490-Capstone-Project--Sharing-is-Caring
Final Project for my INF 490 Capstone Seminar in Informatics Class
The idea of this project was to provide a platform for university students to help each other out- via sharing textbooks, classroom tips, and providing tutoring services. The project is currently incomplete, but it mainly provides the following functionality- a user registration and login system; a classroom tips forum where users can post new topics, comment, and reply to people's comments; a posts feed in the home page that can serve as a "ask a quick question to everyone" function; a textbook rental portal that takes the user to a dynamic table that shows which textbooks are available to rent and who they belong to; and profile pages (with an accompanying posts feed of any post (excluding comments/replies) the user posted or any direct profile page post to that user.  The classroom tips forum in this project was integrated in from an existing project (Inki's PHP and MySQL Tutorial). A link to it is provided below.
